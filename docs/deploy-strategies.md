Choosing a deploy strategy
==========================

Different projects at Caktus use different tools and strategies for
provisioning and deploying. This is partly for historical reasons, but
also because different projects have different requirements.

Strategies that manage most of the details
------------------------------------------

### Simple Fabric

For some of our earliest projects, we just did everything in a
[Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/) script, without the assistance of any
other tools. That\'s error-prone and a lot of work. We would never do
that for a new project, and I\'m not sure any project we still maintain
does that.

### FabulAWS

[FabulAWS](https://fabulaws.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a
Caktus-developed (primarily Tobias) framework for deploying autoscaling,
redundant projects to Amazon Web Services. Its primary advantage is
built-in support for autoscaling: adding and removing servers as the
load on the site changes.

Two projects use FabulAWS that I\'m aware of: CCSR and OpenDebates. Both
can experience heavy loads at times, with significant load changes over
time.

These days, [Elastic
Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) is a credible
alternative to FabuLAWS. It also supports autoscaling, using the same
underlying AWS mechanisms as FabulAWS, and we\'re not responsible for
maintaining it ourselves.

Both FabulAWS and Elastic Beanstalk are tied to AWS.

### Margarita

Most of our current client projects use a Caktus project called
[Margarita](http://caktus.github.io/developer-documentation/margarita/margarita.html)
for deployment, which uses the [Salt](https://saltstack.com/)
configuration management system to deploy the site.

This has worked reasonably well (well enough that we keep using it), but
over time we\'ve discovered a number of shortcomings:

-   Difficulty debugging deploy problems
-   Fragility of Salt updates - many new updates seem to introduce new
    bugs, and the next update that fixes those might have its own new
    bugs. It can be tricky figuring out a version of Salt that works.
-   Resource usage - the Salt master process seems to grow over time to
    use a lot of memory on the server, even though it shouldn\'t be
    doing anything at all when we\'re not deploying. This ties up memory
    our site could be using.

### Tequila

Tequila (see [tequila-\*]{.title-ref} projects on Caktus github) is a
successor project to Margarita, which uses
[Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/) instead of Salt. It is hoped that
Tequila will avoid some of the problems of Margarita.

-   Ansible error messages are much clearer, making debugging deploy
    problems easier.
-   Ansible is agent-less, so when not deploying, it takes no resources
    on the servers.
-   Ansible seems (so far) to have a better track record of not
    introducing regressions with its updates.

At present, Tequila is in a beta state, with several newer projects
trying it out.

Strategies that try to abstract away some of the details
--------------------------------------------------------

### Elastic Beanstalk

[Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) is an AWS
service that provides a nice front-end wrapper around some of their
other services, including Elastic Load balancer and autoscaling. A
[Caktus blog
post](https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2017/03/23/hosting-django-sites-amazon-elastic-beanstalk/)
gave a quick overview.

A big advantage of EB over Margarita, Tequila, and FabulAWS is that it
provides a *higher level of abstraction*, so developers don\'t have to
concern themselves with as many details about the deploy when they just
want something that works.

We inherited one project that was already using Elastic Beanstalk and
have had good experiences with it. It was a big enough project that we
were grateful for the horizontal scaling (multiple web servers behind a
load balancer), and the autoscaling currently ramps servers up and down
during each day as traffic levels vary.

We have not yet worked out a simple way to use something like Celery
(background tasks) with Elastic Beanstalk. There doesn\'t seem to be a
simple way to run something only on one server.

If you needed to dig down into the details more, for example to change
which web server is used, you might find it more work to do than with a
strategy that always exposes all the details.

Elastic Beanstalk is tied to AWS.

### Heroku

We\'ve had a few projects use [Heroku](https://heroku.com). Heroku is a
well-designed and robust service that makes it easy to deploy projects
to the Internet. It provides for easy deploy and scaling like Elastic
Beanstalk. The only drawback is that running a site on Heroku incurs a
premium cost compared to the run-time costs of most of these other
alternatives. Of course, that does not take into account the high cost
of our own labor in developing and maintaining some of these other
solutions. Still, we haven\'t used Heroku much. Mostly we use it for
quick prototypes, or if a client specifically requests it.

### Dokku

[Dokku](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/) is an open-source alternative
to Heroku. It takes the same approach to deploys, but doesn\'t (yet)
offer all the services of Heroku. We are currently trialing Dokku with
some internal projects and one client project.

The advantage of Dokku is that most of the complication of implementing
and maintaining support for all the details needed in a deploy are not
our responsibility, as they are with our Salt, Ansible, and FabulAWS
frameworks. So we would spend fewer of our hours keeping up the deploy
machinery.

Dokku appears best suited to smaller projects, ones where we\'d be
comfortable running on a single server.

That\'s just because it manages things on a per-server level, though;
there\'s no inherent reason you couldn\'t run multiple servers behind a
load balancer, with each server managed using Dokku. Dokku itself just
doesn\'t help you there. (It might not even be that hard to use Ansible
to manage a set of identical dokku servers plus a load balancer; maybe a
Shipit Day project?)

Choosing a deploy strategy
--------------------------

As of this writing (June 2017), here\'s how I\'d recommend choosing a
strategy:

``` {.sourceCode .text}
If the client has a specific request for a strategy and it's feasible
    Use that

If the project already uses a deploy strategy and it's working okay
    Keep using it

If it's a small project (single server) with no unusual requirements,
or no autoscaling is needed:
   If you need something that we know works reasonably well, use Margarita
   If you're willing to beta test a newer strategy, consider Tequila or even Dokku

Else if AWS is an option
    If Elastic Beanstalk meets the project's needs
        Use Elastic Beanstalk
    Else
        Use FabulAWS, possibly customizing it for the project

Else
    Come up with something new because we've run out of options
```

This should come up with something for most projects. We\'d only have
trouble if we had a project needing a lot of scaling that couldn\'t use
AWS for some reason.
