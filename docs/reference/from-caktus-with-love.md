## Growth suggestions from cakti to cakti

** Command Line ** <br>
I highly suggest this [command line](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-linux-command-line-bootcamp/) class by instructor Colt Steele on Udemy. The class covers basic commands such as navigating your system, creating folders, removing files and more important and interesting conceps such as piping, grep, permission and how to alter them, modifying our own command lines, and more. While the class is lenghty, the instructor keeps it fun. There's a lot of power to the command line, and this course helped me tap a bit more into it.

** Save Yourself ** <br>
If you use a *nix* style command line with any frequency and especially if you tend to be heavy handed with `rm -rf` do yourself a favor and install `trash-cli` on Debian derivatives, and add an alias to your shell's `rc` file: `alias rm="trash"`. If you ever make a mistake like I just did you can recover the files.
