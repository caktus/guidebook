### Setting up a Client sub account

If a client needs to have a sub account created for us to use with our assume roles. Follow these instructions.

[First create the sub-account from the organizations root account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html)

Once that is done they will need to log in and do some more work. It is not obvious how to sign in to the sub-account
after they are done with creating it. [Follow these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_access.html)
