Deploying Django projects
=========================

In this section, we talk about two things:

1.  The typical architecture of deployed sites
2.  The interface between our deploy system and our project code -what
    the code in our projects and our deploy system expect from each
    other.

Our deploy system follows many (but not all) of the principles of [the
Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/). If you haven't come across
those before, I suggest you take a look, think through the implications,
then come back here.
