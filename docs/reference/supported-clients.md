Supported Browsers
==================

There are hundreds of browsers that have been released over the course
of the Web's lifetime. There are thousands of distinct versions between
all of these different browsers. We will not be testing every project
across thousands of individual test browsers, so we need to narrow down
the selection to a concise set of browser versions that represent the
largest possible swath of the target user base.

Keep in mind that depending on the project the target user base will be
made of people from different demographics, from different areas, with
distinct technological patterns. The best set of browser versions to
test may differ between projects based on the understanding of this user
base.

Caktus takes a progressive enhancement approach to HTML development.
This means we will provide the best visual rendering to users with
modern browsers. Old browsers that lack support for specific features
will gracefully degrade, maintaining necessary functionality while
losing the compatibility to adapt new cosmetic features only supported
in newer versions.

Caktus conducts quality assurance to verify that the website performs
and functions according to the agreed upon project specifications. This
step includes time to correct bugs and issues discovered by the quality
assurance (QA) process.

Unless otherwise specified, Caktus will test on the following browsers
to ensure that the website functions and renders correctly. The
following browsers / platforms will be supported (current version and
previous version at the time of launch):

-   Chrome
-   Firefox
-   Internet Explorer (11 only)
-   Edge
-   Safari
-   iOS Safari

The rule of thumb is: the latest two versions of Major Browsers. There
are some special cases related to mobile browsers.

Major Browsers
--------------

We consider the following vendors to produce "Major Browsers" for the
purposes of determining a default set of support browsers.

-   Google (Chrome)
-   Mozilla (Firefox)
-   Microsoft (Internet Explorer, Edge)
-   Apple (Safari, Mobile Safari)

Grading System
--------------

We will rate browsers and devices by a simple grading system. This helps
to categorize the approach to support for each browser. As any release
ages, its grade will be reduced.

  Grade   Level of Support Offered
  ------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A       Supported by default in all new projects.
  B       Supported by default, but allowed to present degraded experiences based on unsupported features.
  C       Not supported by default. If required in a project, additional time must be estimated. Support may be degraded.
  D       Not supported by default. Will strongly discourage support at client request.
