App Development Workflow
========================

The core of Caktus' workflow is constant client interaction, showing
progress via continuous deployment, and iteration based on feedback.
This document outlines Caktus' ideal workflow evolution to ensure common
practices are shared across the team (and to inform new team members).
These are provided as defaults and may be adjusted for specific team and
project configurations.

At a high level, we focus on:

-   **Rapid Prototyping and App Design:** User experience and visual
    conditions are established using an iterative and phased approach,
    shifting to coded client demos early on and allowing for ongoing
    development team integration.
-   **Collective Code Ownership, Unit Testing, and Code Reviews:** These
    practices ensure shared knowledge of what is being done, verify
    correct functioning of all code, and the code is following community
    and team-established standards.

Workflow Diagram

The above diagram illustrates the evolution of a typical project
workflow:

-   The **Workshop** phase focuses on discovery and requirements
    gathering to establish a plan to begin development.
-   The **Task rows** highlight the typical tasks and skills needed for
    Caktus projects. They do not correspond directly to individual roles
    nor must they always be followed sequentially. Project teams
    self-assemble for the optimum configuration.
-   The **Phase columns** illustrate how the set of high level project
    tasks may evolve throughout a project life-cycle. For example,
    static wireframes ideally progress to HTML Prototypes once core
    templates and user flows are established. Project teams, depending
    on project requirements, may elect to start with a later phase.
