# Reference

[Current](current) contains docs that should reflect the current operational skeleton of Caktus. Look here first.

[Pre 2021](pre-2021) contains docs that were developed from 2015 to 2021. There may be good stuff in there. The idea is
to bring all that is good and wonderful in there into the current docs.
