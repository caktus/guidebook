# Developer Onboarding Documentation
This documentation is meant for new developers at Caktus Group to follow. It describes our particular
setup and development workflow. It is not meant as a prescription but as a path that is well tested and is 
known to work. Of course there are some steps, which if not followed, will result in an inability to use or 
access services. So if you know the consequences of straying from the Golden Path feel free to play around
with these setup steps. If you are fresh faced and apple cheeked, best to follow exactly.

See you on the other side and happy coding.
