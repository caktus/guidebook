# The Apple M1

Historically our dev workflows and setup have revolved around x86 architecture. The M1 is 
new and can be a bit of a problem setting up. As you work through this process, please update
this doc with quirks, tricks, or best practices you come across.

!!! warning

    As of the commit of this documentation, the following blog is the best place to start. Forge your own path at your
    and your colleagues risk. Right now it is very easy to get into a state where confusing things happen.

Colin's blog post [Python, Django, and React Development on Apple Silicon](https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2021/04/02/python-django-react-development-apple-silicon/ "Python Django React Apple Silicon").

Another post [Django Development Environment on Apple M1](https://www.djangocookbook.com/recipes/django-development-environment-on-apple-m1/)

## Environment setup


### Rosetta 2 and Xcode

First, make sure Rosetta 2 is installed. [Rosetta 2](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861) enables a Mac with Apple silicon to use apps built for a Mac with an Intel processor. Install it with:

```shell
softwareupdate --install-rosetta  --agree-to-license
```

Also, install Xcode's command-line tools for `python3` and other useful libraries:

```shell
xcode-select --install
```


### Generating a new SSH key

Follow GitHub's [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) instructions for these sections:

  * Generating a new SSH key
  * Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent


#### Configure Git name and email

To associate your `git` commits to your GitHub account, we will set your [name](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git#setting-your-git-username-for-every-repository-on-your-computer) and [email address](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git) for every repository on your computer.

First set your name:

```shell
git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"
```

Then set your email:

```shell
git config --global user.email "mlisa@caktusgroup.com"
```


### Homebrew

Homebrew does [support Apple Silicon](https://brew.sh/2020/12/01/homebrew-2.6.0/). However, a particular package may not run natively, so your mileage may vary. To support running both native arm64 and x86-emulated homebrew packages, you install them side-by-side.

Install arm64 ``brew`` into ``/opt/homebrew``:

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Then add `brew` to your PATH:

```shell
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### Install openssl

```shell
brew install openssl
```


### Starship Prompt

Starship is a simple and customizable shell prompt. Follow the [Quick Install](https://starship.rs/#quick-install) instructions to get set up.


!!! note
    
    Make sure to install a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) to render 
    glyph symbols (:octicons-repo-forked-16:, :material-snake:) properly. Then enable the font
    in your terminal:

    - **iTerm2**: Open *iTerm2 → Preferences → Profiles → Text* and set *Font* to your Nerd Font.
    - **Visual Studio Code**: Open *Code → Preferences → Settings* (Mac), enter `terminal.integrated.fontFamily` in the search box at the top of *Settings* ta and set the value below to your Nerd Font.


### Install pyenv

```
brew install pyenv
```

Add the following to the bottom of your `.zshrc`:

```shell
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```


### Install direnv

Next install [direnv](https://direnv.net/), which will load/unload environment variables based on a `.envrc` file.

```shell
brew install direnv
```

In your user's Home directory create a file `.direnvrc`

```shell
$> touch ~/.direnvrc
```

Then edit that file and add the following to it using your favorite text editor, and add
the following.

```shell
# use a certain pyenv version
use_python() {
    if [ -n "$(which pyenv)" ]; then
        local pyversion=$1
        pyenv local ${pyversion}
    fi
}

use_cluster() {
    kubectl config use-context "$1"
}

layout_virtualenv() {
    local pyversion=$1
    local pvenv=$2
    if [ -n "$(which pyenv virtualenv)" ]; then
        pyenv virtualenv --force --quiet ${pyversion} ${pvenv}-${pyversion}
    fi
    pyenv local --unset
}

layout_activate() {
    if [ -n "$(which pyenv)" ]; then
        source $(pyenv root)/versions/$1/bin/activate
    fi
}

```

### Install pyenv

Next install a new version of python for example:

```shell
pyenv install --list
```

```shell
pyenv install 3.9.2
```

Add the following lines to your `~/.zshrc`:

```shell
eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"
```

### Install PostgreSQL

Even if you don't run the PostgreSQL service, it can be helpful to install the CLI tools with:

```shell
HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1 brew install postgresql
```

### Install Docker

Visit https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/ and click the _Mac with Apple chip_ blue button, then:

1. Once downloaded, copy the Docker application to your Applications folder
2. Then open the Docker app in the Applications folder


   ### A. Streamlined version of Colin's article here)

   ### C. Starship config `xarch` (architecture switching function in .toml).
   ### D. VSCode setup.

### 2. Project setup

   TBD any additional issues that may arise from containers or aws services.


## Currently Identified Additions to .zshrc for M1 Users


```shell
alias ibrew='arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/brew'

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh" ] && . "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm" ] && . "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm"  # This loads nvm bash_completion

autoload -U add-zsh-hook
load-nvmrc() {
  local node_version="$(nvm version)"
  local nvmrc_path="$(nvm_find_nvmrc)"

  if [ -n "$nvmrc_path" ]; then
    local nvmrc_node_version=$(nvm version "$(cat "${nvmrc_path}")")

    if [ "$nvmrc_node_version" = "N/A" ]; then
      nvm install
    elif [ "$nvmrc_node_version" != "$node_version" ]; then
      nvm use
    fi
  elif [ "$node_version" != "$(nvm version default)" ]; then
    echo "Reverting to nvm default version"
    nvm use default
  fi
}
add-zsh-hook chpwd load-nvmrc
load-nvmrc

# Add homebrew to path
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"

# C-lib complication flags
export LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib -L$(brew --prefix zlib)/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include -I$(brew --prefix zlib)/include"

# Hook in direnv
eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"

# pyenv
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

After adding this to your `.zshrc`, source the file to make it available to your current 
environment.

```shell
$> source ~/.zshrc
```
