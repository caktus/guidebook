# The Apple M1

Historically our dev workflows and setup have revolved around x86 architecture. The M1 is 
new and can be a bit of a problem setting up. As you work through this process, please update
this doc with quirks, tricks, or best practices you come across.

!!! warning

    As of the commit of this documentation, the following blog is the best place to start. Forge your own path at your
    and your colleagues risk. Right now it is very easy to get into a state where confusing things happen.

1. Colin's blog post [Python, Django, and React Development on Apple Silicon](https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2021/04/02/python-django-react-development-apple-silicon/ "Python Django React Apple Silicon")

# 1. Environment setup


## Rosetta 2 and Command Line Tools for Xcode

First, make sure Rosetta 2 is installed. [Rosetta 2](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861) enables a Mac with Apple silicon to use apps built for a Mac with an Intel processor. Install it with:

```sh
softwareupdate --install-rosetta  --agree-to-license
```

Also, install Xcode's command-line tools for `python3` and other useful libraries:

```
xcode-select --install
```


## Generating a new SSH key

Follow GitHub's [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) instructions for these sections:

  * Generating a new SSH key
  * Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent


## Install Homebrew

Homebrew does [support Apple Silicon](https://brew.sh/2020/12/01/homebrew-2.6.0/). However, a particular package may not run natively, so your mileage may vary. To support running both native arm64 and x86-emulated homebrew packages, you install them side-by-side.

Install arm64 ``brew`` into ``/opt/homebrew``:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```


## Install Starship

Starship is a minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable shell prompt. Follow the [Quick Install](https://starship.rs/#quick-install) instructions to get set up.



   ### A. Streamlined version of Colin's article here)
   ### B. `.zshrc` modifications (handles brew and nvm issues).
   ### C. Starship config `xarch` (architecture switching function in .toml).
   ### D. VSCode setup.

### 2. Project setup
   ### A. Instructions on `direnv` virtual environment setup for any given project.
   ### B. Document how this is handled in `Jade Truffle` and linked here for all M1 users.
   
   TBD any additional issues that may arise from containers or aws services.
        
        
## Currently Identified Additions to .zshrc for M1 Users
