Github
======

Every project needs a source code repository and we usually use Github
to host ours. This assumes that you\'ll be creating the repo in the
Caktus organization, but the process is the same for any other
organization\... you\'ll just need the permissions to do so.

1.  Once you have your project set up locally, initialize your git
    repository and commit your files:

    ``` {.sourceCode .bash}
    ~/myproject$ git init
    ~/myproject$ git commit -m "Initial project setup"
    ```

2.  You\'ll need a Github account and your account must have been added
    to the [Developers](https://github.com/orgs/caktus/teams/developers)
    team in the Caktus organization. Ask another developer, or create a
    [support
    request](https://caktus.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3)
    to accomplish that.
3.  [Create a new
    repo](https://github.com/organizations/caktus/repositories/new).
    This will walk you through creating a repo.
    A.  Leave the \'Initialize this repository with a README\' checkbox
        **unchecked**, as you\'ll most likely be importing a repo.
    B.  Don\'t worry about the .gitignore and LICENSE dropdowns. Our
        project template has its own .gitignore and while it\'s
        convenient to add a LICENSE here, it would be easier to just add
        that to your existing repo.
4.  Click the \'Create repo\' button, which will take you to a page with
    various instructions depending on your situation. We\'ll use the
    second set of instructions, labelled, \'\...or push an existing
    repository from the command line\'. Replace `myproject` with the
    name of your newly created project.

    ``` {.sourceCode .bash}
    ~/myproject$ git remote add origin https://github.com/caktus/myproject.git
    ~/myproject$ git push -u origin master
    ```

5.  Review the \'Settings\' tab to configure the repository to your
    preferences:
    A.  Manage outside collaborators.
    B.  Link Github to other services (such as HipChat, Travis CI, etc.)
    C.  Manage branches. You can set the default branch to \'develop\'
        and enable branch protection which can prevent force pushes to
        certain branches, or require Travis CI to run successfully on a
        PR before it gets merged, for example.

Private Repos
-------------

If you created a private repo, you\'ll need to make sure that your
deployment servers are allowed to check out your code. Once your staging
server is up and running, follow [our instructions for setting up the
deploy
key](https://github.com/caktus/django-project-template/blob/master/docs/provisioning.rst#github-deploy-keys).
