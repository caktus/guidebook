App Development Workflow
########################

The core of Caktus’ workflow is constant client interaction, showing progress
via continuous deployment, and iteration based on feedback. This document
outlines Caktus’ ideal workflow evolution to ensure common practices are shared
across the team (and to inform new team members). These are provided as defaults
and may be adjusted for specific team and project configurations.

At a high level, we focus on:

* **Rapid Prototyping and App Design:** User experience and visual conditions are established using an iterative and phased approach, shifting to coded client demos early on and allowing for ongoing development team integration.
* **Collective Code Ownership, Unit Testing, and Code Reviews:** These practices ensure shared knowledge of what is being done, verify correct functioning of all code, and the code is following community and team-established standards.

The above diagram illustrates the evolution of a typical project workflow:

* The **Workshop** phase focuses on discovery and requirements gathering to establish a plan to begin development.
* The **Task rows** highlight the typical tasks and skills needed for Caktus projects. They do not correspond directly to individual roles nor must they always be followed sequentially. Project teams self-assemble for the optimum configuration.
* The **Phase columns** illustrate how the set of high level project tasks may evolve throughout a project life-cycle. For example, static wireframes ideally progress to HTML Prototypes once core templates and user flows are established. Project teams, depending on project requirements, may elect to start with a later phase.
